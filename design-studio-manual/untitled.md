# Connection

New Connection

A new connection is created by selecting the **ADD NEW** button present in the Connection wizard. A name must be associated with a new connection for this to be distinguished from those saved previously. All the connections created are listed in the column to the left of the wizard.

To use a previously saved connection, double click on the connection name. This will be run automatically and, if the credentials have been previously saved, it will be possible to access DAC-DS. Otherwise, you will need to enter the credentials.

For a New Connection, you must enter the following parameters, in addition to the parameters listed in the Quick Connection:

* **Connection Name :** connection name
* **Remember Password:** if selected, the user password will be saved
* **Metadata DB**: if **Remote** is selected, the following parameters must be entered:
  * **Username:** Username for the connection to the DB
  * **Password:** Password for the connection to the DB
  * **Host:** Database Host
  * **Port:** Database Port
  * **Schema:** Database scheme
  * **Test Connection:** the button runs a test of the configured connection.

## Edit or Clone Connection

After selecting the connection to be edited, the panel displays a summary of the data for this connection.

In addition to the credentials, the details of the connection are shown in terms of Endpoint, Space, Metadata DB and Organization. Click the Edit button or select the menu item that is activated from the shortcut menu to modify any of the parameters. To clone the connection, select the Clone item.
