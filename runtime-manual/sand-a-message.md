# Sand a Message

DAC allows users to interact with each other in real time. Communication between users occurs with text messages whose function mirrors the chat function.

A message can be addressed to one or more people. So, you can establish a chat with a single person or a group - it is nevertheless private to the person or group that you establish the chat with.

A window opens like the one shown in the figure below.

You can send a text message from different sections where there is a reference to the user, such as from a user profile or the author of content, etc.

The messages received are viewed on the Top menu of the user involved in the communication, on the notification button.

By accessing your Incoming mail, you can display the entire history of the conversation.

If the conversation involves more than two users, you can perform either of the following operations:

* **Share**: you can invite one or more users to the conversation.

Users invited to the conversation can view its complete history.

* **Farward**: forward the message to another user or space

The list of messages where the user is involved or is the author are listed in the [Incoming Mail](incoming-mail.md)
