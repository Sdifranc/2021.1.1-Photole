# Custom Error

DAC allows you to customize the error messages displayed by the user while using the application. It can also customize error messages generated by the exception of an Execute button or exceptions generated by Report CRUD API.

To create a custom error message, access to the **Administration &gt;&gt; Custom error** section.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** A custom error can also be a business labels, using a tag as value of the given key:

key: NullPointerException

value: &lt;\#NPE/&gt;

where &lt;\#NPE/&gt; is a tag of an existing Business Labels, will show the translation associated with that tag as error message.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Into:** Custom message can be Synchronised to a target environment selecting “Languages” as synchronisable item.
{% endhint %}

The message customization is enabled only for administrator users.

When creating a new message you need to create a key. The keyword used must refer to a word used in the message that we want to customize. For example:

If we wanted to customize the message in the figure below, its keyword could be the following:  
KEY: NullPointerException.
