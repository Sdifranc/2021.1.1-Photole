# Document Reading

Users who have read-only privileges are those assigned in the Visibility folder in the privileges window.

The figure below shows the display of a document for a user with reading privileges.

In addition to the document content, certain **information** about the content is also indicated, such as how many people have seen it, category, and tags assigned, who created or edited it, etc. The number of document versions is also indicated \(only in read-only mode\). Users with edit privileges are responsible for their use.

The section dedicated to **comments** is shown at the bottom: those comments already inserted, and the section for sending a new comment.
