You can create documents defined directly in DAC using an advanced text editor. This text editor allows you to format the text and enter images, tables, and links to videos or Pages.

You create a document like a new object, using the menu opened from the ![](../../.gitbook/assets/1%20%282%29.png) button and selecting Create document.

You can share documents with other users, both in read-only and in edit mode, depending on the privileges assigned. Users who have access to the document can also comment on it.

Documents can also be published on social spaces. This is where users can read or edit them, depending on the privileges assigned.
