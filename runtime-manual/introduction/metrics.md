# Metrics

## Introduction

In addition to using default metrics, you can also create new ones.

Starting from a report it will be possible to define new composite metrics**,** such as a combination of those in the same report. These will be used exclusively by the report and will not be added to those published by the administrator.

The format of the metrics pertains to the style and color of the characters, as well as the formatting which depends on the threshold value. You can change the format of the metrics, which will remain exclusively used by the report in which it was defined.

The decoration formatting of the metrics can only be defined in a development environment.
