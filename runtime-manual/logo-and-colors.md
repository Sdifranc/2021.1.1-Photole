The customization of the DAC allows to:

* customize the icon and title of the browser \(to display the new icon it could be necessary to clear the cache\);
* customize the logo associated with the Main Toolbar \(and whether to make it visible or not\); changing the application colors, choosing the primary and secondary colors.
* customize the background image for the login page
* It is also possible to activate a live preview, which will allow to browse the applications and check how the changes will be applied before saving.
