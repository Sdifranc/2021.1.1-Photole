# General Information

The **General** **Information** section contains technical information on configuring DAC, such as the AS memory status, Activation Key, App Composer environment Variables, log etc.

**App Composer Environment Variables**

![](https://dac-docs.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/ImgSito/RunTime/GenerlInfo/3.jpg)

Environment variables defined at the operating system level can be used throughout the DAC.

Some of the Decisyon object that could leverage this features:

* **Data sources:** to leverage JDBC string created as env variable.
* **REST client:** to leverage bearer token of external services or URL to external services
* **Page editor:** to leverage any environment variable as Decisyon variable
* **SMTP server:** to leverage SMTP parameters as environment variable.\(host, user, port, password\) of the SMTP server.
* it’s possible to use App Composer Environment Variables in specifying any connection settings \(user, host, jdbc url,…\) of a database-based data source

Environment variables can be created for all those objects that could change depending on the target environment. The change of target environment could occur during a migration for example from Test to Development or Production. In this way, taking advantage of the environment variables, it will not be necessary to change the values ​​in the destination.

The environment variables used by Design Studio will be created in the operating system where the DS is installed the same thing for the RunTime.

When creating an environment variable in the operating system, the name must start with the prefix DAC\_ENV. \(for example _**%DAC\_ENV\_&lt;parameter&gt;%**_ \). The Dac will only recognize environment variables with this prefix.

#### Summary schema of variables <a id="Summary-schema-of-variables"></a>

* **SMTP :** the variable must be delimited by the **%** character e.g. %DAC\_ENV\_HOST% to be configured both on the O.S. where the DS is located and on the application server.
* **API rest:** the variable must be delimited by the **{{ }}** character e.g.{{DAC\_ENV\_HOST }} to be configured both on the O.S. where the DS is located and on the application server.
* **Datasource rest:** the variable must be delimited by the **{{ }}** character e.g.{{DAC\_ENV\_HOST }} to be configured both on the O.S. where the DS is located and on the application server.

It is possible to consult the list of system variables recognized by the DAC by accessing the "General information" panel "Environment variables of the app composer"

#### Log

The **Log Export**, which allows the user to export the log files generated by DAC during use of the system. The file generated is saved in ._**zip**_ format.

You also set _the level_ of information to be saved for the logging operation. The available **modes are listed** in the **Log Level** field:

* ALL monitors and saves any information
* _DEBUG_ any information relating to debugging for the normal use of the system
* _INFO_ for various kinds of information such as the operations performed at system level \(e.g_. cleaning datamarts\)_
* _WARN_ for system warnings
* _ERROR_ any error which occurs during execution of the application
* _FATAL_ errors considered fatal by the system
* OFF to disable system logging

#### Resources

In the Resource section it’s possible to:

* Reset the **document repository cache**
* Update **static resource** e.g. image, script etc.
* Reset the **system labels** \( for example if you have a new label it is not necessary to reconnect to the application but it is sufficient to reset it from here\).
